    <h1>Hey, welcome! I'm glad you want to get to know me.</h1>
    <p>The first thing to get out of the way is that I am a woman, and I'm deeply passionate about developing women's resources and communities, especially in traditionally male-dominated domains. I went to a women's college, you see, and until I had the opportunity to be in a focused, intentional community like that, I had no idea how strong my voice could be. Nothing but good can come of helping to pay that strength forward.</p>
    <p>Right after college, I went into politics. It was great - it was my way of doing everything I could to create the future that I wanted. It was also exhausting, though, and my type of engagement (direct voter engagement in campaigns) usually meant I had to pick up and move every 7-12 months. It was fun! I got to travel the country and live in different communities and meet so many amazing people, but eventually it was also exhausting. I decided to come back to California to be closer to family.</p>
    <p>Once I got back home, I realized that I had become so wrapped up in my work that I had neglected to build myself any personal development space. It took a while, but I finally realized that code was the thing that checked all the boxes - ignited passion, wonder, and who doesn't love the sense of satisfaction that comes with building something from scratch? With endless opportunities for forward progress and the promise of perpetual learning, I have found myself at home in this challenge.</p>
    <p>I started teaching myself to code using sites like FCC, Udacity, and edX. Eventually, I realized that balancing two jobs and my new love of programs wasn't working out. I decided to make the leap into an immersive program, got my financial ducks in a row, and decided to start Lambda School in August. I'm not even done yet, and I already know it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.</p>
